# Car Guardian

## Project Background
The primary issue we are addressing stems from the increased average age of cars on the road, standing at 12.5 years. This implies that a significant portion of cars lacks modern safety features. Since 63% of vehicles in the United States predate 2015, a majority of drivers face heightened vulnerability, lacking crucial safety advancements to mitigate risks effectively. The main objective of our project was to equip older cars with new safety features that they lack in order to increase the safety of drivers on the road, and decrease the amount of information that a driver needs to keep track of while driving. 

## Project Requirements
Main Features: Precollsion detection, Traffic light detection, Intelligent video clipping and standard dash cam features

Object Detection: 85% accuracy in detection, The calculated distances using YOLO is within a 10% margin of error from the actual distance

Traffic Obstacle Detection: Detect the color of traffic lights and stop signs with a 95% accuracy, Light detection at distances high enough for appropriate braking distance depending on distance
